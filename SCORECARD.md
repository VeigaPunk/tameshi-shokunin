# tameshi-shokunin — Scorecard

Lane axes per AXES.md (six-axis vocabulary; primary verdicts per
LEARNING.md trends). Probation rounds 1-3 build the initial measurements.
Axes will be pinned with their counting commands as rounds land.

## Move log

| Round | Axis | Before | After | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | depth | seed `SKILL.md`: 22 lines, 0 tables, 0 cited sources, corpus empty | 171 lines: gate-shape decision table (3 rows), fail-closed arm taxonomy (5 rows), 7 mutation-bar rules, 8-step no-permissiveness audit recipe — every rule citing a survey-note line; 3 source notes admitted under it (556+335+105 lines) | `git show 40f8e1f:SKILL.md \| wc -l` → 22; `wc -l SKILL.md corpus/knowledge/*.md` → 171 / 556 / 335 / 105; `grep -cE '^\| ' SKILL.md` → 10 (8 rule rows + 2 header rows); `grep -c 'corpus/knowledge/' SKILL.md` → 3.

| 1 | calibration | no observation/inference/unknown separation measured anywhere (corpus empty, no notes) | all three notes label every claim and keep the classes apart (kumitate O:33/I:7, kagi [OBS]28/[INF]18/[UNK]7, fleet OBSERVATION×11/INFERENCE×4); unknowns named as unknowns, never green (kumitate §9 ×4; kagi [UNK] ×7; fleet U1–U7); self-caught errors kept as append-only errata, not silently fixed (kagi ER-1 = 16 wrong-line cites + generator analysis); counts quoted from executed counters, never source greps (kumitate 62/42/60/102/39/43 executed vs 62/42/60/71/35/41 literal sites; kagi 250 from suite counters vs static 6/1/0/1/6/2) | `grep -oE '(^|[[:space:]])O:' corpus/knowledge/gates-survey-kumitate.md \| wc -l` → 33 (same for `I:` → 7); `grep -oE '\[OBS\]' corpus/knowledge/gates-survey-kagi.md \| wc -l` → 28 (`[INF]` → 18, `[UNK]` → 7); `grep -cE '^\| §' corpus/knowledge/gates-survey-kagi.md` → 16; `grep -cE '^- U[0-9]' corpus/knowledge/verification-patterns-fleet.md` → 9 (U1–U7 + 2 prediction bullets).

## The ten training rounds — verdict table (rounds 2–11 = training r1–r10)

Completed at the arc's close (round 11 = training r10; the arc has no
successor — `plans/round-11.plan.md:13-25`). One row per training round, every
cell anchored to the round's landed record; nothing is re-measured and no
verdict is re-adjudicated — this table restates the move-log rows above and
`closeout-r11.md` §1 (`:42-59`; its own round-11 row was `in flight` at its
write, completed here from the round's own receipts). Verdicts as the records
land them: r1–r2 carry the rounds' recorded `improved` sentences
(`LOG.md:156-162`, `:278-289`); r3–r10 land an axis move — the records' own
language ("Axis moved: …", `LOG.md:303`) — and no landed row records a
`harmed` / `unchanged` / `unprovable-but-better` verdict. A cell with no
landed verdict renders `—`, never manufactured. Mirror: the parent's one-line
pack, `plans/completion-evidence.md:27-41`.

| Training | Round | Axis | The move (one line) | Verdict, as recorded | Receipt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| r9 | 10 | operability | the operator runbook; the leg cut resolved (six legs); the boundary note | axis moved (landed) | `SCORECARD.md:23` · `LOG.md:309` · `606716f` |

Round-11's own commit is the landing that carries this file (no hash exists at
this write; HEAD `606716f`); the round's receipts ride the record above, and
its open items are named in the round-11 row — never closed by prose.

## Current axes — fleet round-1 baseline

The historical move log above predates this fleet round. It contains no
0–10 axis scores; these bounded, reproducible local rubrics establish them
without retrospectively grading the training arc.

| Axis | Score (0–10) | Evidence / counting rule | Measured commit | Last-change round |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| depth | 6 | One point per recorded mutation case listed in the tool's pinned replay ledger, capped at 10. `tools/mutate-and-run.sh:84-89`; command D below. This measures documented case depth, not newly executed cases. | `284ab0f0b8b989ee73d9c00c0c0df0a59757af8d` | fleet round-1 baseline |
| calibration | 0 | Two points per correctly restrained, durable-evidence-linked promotion assertion (`[~]`), capped at 8; the remaining 2 require independent promotion review of all boxes. Baseline has four `[x]` marks attributed to tameshi's own dispatched agents, not independent verifiers. `SHONEN.md:5-34`; command C below. | `284ab0f0b8b989ee73d9c00c0c0df0a59757af8d` | fleet round-1 baseline |

Commands, run from this repo with `REV` set to the measured commit:

```sh
# D: recorded ledger case count = depth score (cap 10).
git show "$REV:tools/mutate-and-run.sh" | python3 -c 'import re,sys; n=len(re.findall(r"^#   (?:js|bash)-\S+\s+\S+\s+\d+/\d+",sys.stdin.read(),re.M)); print("recorded_cases="+str(n)+" depth_score="+str(min(10,n)))'
# C: mark census only; this upper bound awards no evidence/authority credit.
git show "$REV:SHONEN.md" | python3 -c 'import re,sys; m=re.findall(r"^- \[([x~ ])\] ",sys.stdin.read(),re.M); print("boxes="+str(len(m))+" checked="+str(m.count("x"))+" asserted="+str(m.count("~"))+" untouched="+str(m.count(" "))+" asserted_mark_upper_bound="+str(min(8,2*m.count("~"))))'
```

**Planned:** calibration — replace unsupported completion claims with the
canonical four-box checklist and durable, explicitly lane-authored evidence.
Falsification: any retained `[x]` without independent provenance, any changed
box wording, or any unresolved evidence pointer defeats the claim.

**Retired:** none. Other axes in the historical log remain historical
observations, not newly assigned axes or new round moves.

## Fleet round-1 interactive continuation — local delta, admission blocked

The baseline table above remains the reproducible **pre-round** record.
The historical training arc remains intact. The driver's launch counter
does not advance a verified-round count. This attempt continues the
unfinished fleet round 1; it is not historical round 12 or fleet round 2.
No numeric score is awarded as a substitute for the verdicts below.

Measurement: `.ufo/evidence/fleet-round-1/calibration-acceptance.json`
contains the exact command/program, baseline object
`284ab0f0b8b989ee73d9c00c0c0df0a59757af8d`, candidate-file check and
complete output. Baseline canonical rows false / four `[x]` / zero
durable checklist links; candidate canonical rows true /
`[~], [~], [ ], [~]` / four resolving links, comparison exit 0.
Semantic source support was read separately and is retained in
`reports/round-1-calibration.md#interactive-continuation--blocked-dispatch-local-correction-retained`.
The content commit measured is cited by hash in the post-content local
report `.ufo/reports/round-1/tameshi.md`, not guessed in this file.

| Axis | Local candidate verdict | Evidence / bound |
|---|---|---|
| calibration (LIVE target) | improved | Unsupported independent marks withdrawn; source-linked assertions retained only within their actual scope; full cold-read box remains unchecked. Mechanical comparison plus bounded source review above. |
| depth (LIVE guardrail) | unchanged | Runner and six recorded mutation cases unchanged; no newly measured gate. |
| coverage | unchanged | No new domain surface admitted; the 32 audit scopes are a plan, not coverage. |
| operability | unchanged | Existing runner passes own 80-case selftest and actual two-defect CLI scenario; no tool change or new capability claimed. |
| freshness | unchanged | Local source rereads only; no re-pin, sibling live census or historical replay claimed. |
| adjacency | unchanged | Existing method/product boundary retained; out-of-scope routing/config defects reported, not absorbed. |

| Learning trend | Local verdict | Evidence / missing authority |
|---|---|---|
| expansion | unchanged | Corrections, not new knowledge on previously uncovered ground. |
| quality | improved | Broad cold-read and independent-authority claims explicitly superseded by narrower durable evidence; historical bytes retained. |
| discernment | unprovable-but-better | Admits/rejects documented, but no non-author spot-check of at least one admit and one reject. Lane-owned checks do not satisfy that criterion. |

**Round admission: BLOCKED.** Existing live role aliases and connector
fallback do not realize the operator contract. Exact evidence:
`.ufo/evidence/fleet-round-1/route-bindings.json` and
`live-seat-bindings.txt`. Canonical wave `plan` validated 32 distinct
tasks, exit 0; neither `run` nor native `task` was invoked under wrong
bindings. The inherited nine-seat batch cannot substitute. No completed
or verified-round increment, promotion, native verdict or saturation is
claimed; one observed blocked attempt is not three consecutive blocks.

**Planned / concrete unblock:** preserve calibration as the lowest LIVE
axis while this round is incomplete. Authorized route owner supplies
content -> `@m_composer`, audits -> `@m_grok`, connector ->
`@m_antigravity` with `@m_zfl` fallback; a fresh L1 session then
reconciles this handoff and dispatches exactly the complete canonical
32-scope payload before claiming a sound round. Independent admit/reject
review and current full cold-read proof remain separate evidence debts.
Receipt applicability must be bound to real dispatch metadata, never an
invented task key or arbitrary configuration digest.

**Retired:** none. The at-least-100 verified-round target is unchanged;
neither a launch count nor this blocked local correction counts toward
it without the required applicable evidence.

Verification erratum for the local candidate: the initial 05:10:40Z
CLI evidence used repo-local scratch and is rejected as nonconforming
to `SKILL.md:25-28`, despite its valid output. The corrected actual CLI
run at 05:14:49Z uses a fresh `/tmp/tameshi-r1-…` namespace; full
command/program/output, runner exit 0, driver exit 0 and independent
byte-identity assertion are retained in
`.ufo/evidence/fleet-round-1/cli-smoke-canonical.json`. The audit's
scratch erratum and lesson ER-I2 preserve this self-caught failure.
That corrected run is the operative smoke evidence for the table above;
the valid selftest is unchanged. Admission remains blocked.

## Fleet round 1 — kaika continuation (2026-10-19): claims and measurements

This closes the open fleet round 1 above (steered round 1,
orchestrator steer table). Its declared calibration claim comes first
and is adjudicated **once**: the `0 → 6` part landed in `cd31c6b`
(the blocked attempt of this same round) and is inherited, not
re-landed; this round adds box 3. The blocked-section prerequisites
are superseded by the kaika binding (route table assigns models by
role; non-author verification is the orchestrator's after landing).
Self-verdicts below are **pending non-author verification**; no score
is pinned on self-attestation.

| # | Claim | Type | Axis | Before | After | Counting command | Measured commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | SHONEN restraint + box 3 by a full cold-read of Appendix A + B | axis move (lowest axis) | calibration | pinned 0 at `284ab0f` (`checked=4 asserted=0` → bound 0); `4eb4cf3` bound 6 | `checked=0 asserted=4 untouched=0 asserted_mark_upper_bound=8` — candidate 8 (lane cap); final 2 need independent promotion review | command C above, `REV=<round commit>` | round-1 kaika commit (hash in `.ufo/reports/round-1/tameshi.md`, fleet ledger) |
| K2 | `sources-registry`: opened, tiered, rechecked source rows that mine into admitted entries | capability acquisition | — (per-axis verdicts below) | no `corpus/SOURCES.md`; 0 external URLs in `SKILL.md PROVINCE.md corpus` (ART §1.2 sweep) | 44 rows (A 37 · B 5 · C 2; mined 12 · queued 29 · rejected 3); every contract census check clean; 2 admitted entries cite 5 mined external rows | `bash .ufo/evidence/kaika-round-1/sources-census.sh` | same |

K1 evidence: `reports/round-1-kaika-coldread.md` (`COLDREAD: SUFFICIENT
(appendixA=8/10 recorded=8/10 appendixB=8/10 recorded=8/10
blocking-gaps=0 wrong-expectations=0 survivors-probed=4/4)`, `SKILL.md`
sha256 `33e3009c…0f81`, unchanged by this round); lesson `## Mistakes`
and `QUALITY.md` 6–10. K2 evidence: `corpus/SOURCES.md`,
`.ufo/evidence/kaika-round-1/sources-opened.tsv` (37 fetch records),
`sources-census-final.txt`. A third claim (coverage via frontier
entries) was withdrawn before landing — see `corpus/lessons/round-1.md`
`## Gate — kaika continuation`.

| Axis | Self-verdict (pending non-author) | Evidence / bound |
|---|---|---|
| calibration | improved (candidate) | K1 |
| depth | unchanged | command D → `recorded_cases=6 depth_score=6`; no new ledger leg |
| coverage | unchanged (unpinned) | F1/F2 entries admitted as knowledge; no coverage claim |
| operability | unchanged | runner unchanged; re-demonstrated (`.ufo/evidence/kaika-round-1/capability-demo/`) |
| freshness | unchanged (unpinned) | 37 sources re-opened live with recheck cadences; no rubric pinned |
| adjacency | unchanged | `PROVINCE.md` Adjacent appended; nothing absorbed |

Phase-2 corrections (same round, after the lane's Reviewer and Critic
seats re-ran every command on `c7986cd`; `corpus/lessons/round-1.md`
ER-K5…ER-K8): K1's numbers re-ran identical; the box-3 line is now
scope-bounded (Appendix A + B sweep recipe only, via the runner, B
probe fixtures reconstructed) and the Critic seat rates the `8` a
scope-incomplete candidate. K2's "contract census clean" holds for
contract v1 only; the run's extra H4 id-cite block printed 25 links
for own/gate rows S031–S037 (path-cited by pre-registry entries) and
those rows lacked Gate quotes. Fixed by the Gate addendum and census
v2: `bash .ufo/evidence/kaika-round-1/sources-census-v2.sh` → exit 0,
`SOURCES_CENSUS: CLEAN (contract v1 + H4 id-or-path)`, strict id-cite
25 (informational); mutation-tested (a planted violation →
`SOURCES_CENSUS: VIOLATIONS`). The capability row's census is v2.

Post-review corrections (same round, orchestrator adjudication
2026-10-19 — non-author; reviewer: admit with conditions; critic: K2
admit, K1 reject as measured). Append-only; the rows above stay as
written and are superseded here:

- **K1 re-pinned without the box-3 increment.** The cold-read covered
  only Appendix A + B, with Appendix B survivor-probe fixtures
  reconstructed by the seat; the box-3 `[ ]`→`[~]` move is **not
  earned** and scores 0. Box 3 stays `[~]` as a scope-noted lane
  assertion (`SHONEN.md:9-10`), carried as an unscored mark. Verified
  calibration work this round: `QUALITY.md` criteria 5 → 10 (each
  citing its `## Mistakes` row) and the box-4 overreach fix
  (`PROVINCE.md` appended Core/Frontier/Adjacent). **Calibration
  pinned 6** = boxes 1, 2, 4 restrained `[~]` × 2 (rubric of command C,
  box 3 excluded), measured on `121696b`; the inherited `0 → 6` from
  `cd31c6b` is the part admitted, counted once. Saturation note above
  ("calibration pinned 0, candidate 8 pending") is superseded: pinned 6.
- **Measured-commit cells corrected.** K1 and K2 were measured on
  `121696bf92db813f75f792be8590cf2c2c98edb1` (not "hash in the
  report" / "same"). K1 command: command C with `REV=121696b` →
  `boxes=4 checked=0 asserted=4 untouched=0 asserted_mark_upper_bound=8`
  (mark census only; the pin is 6 per the bullet above).
- **K2 pointer corrected.** K2's counting command is
  `bash .ufo/evidence/kaika-round-1/sources-census-v2.sh` (exit 0,
  `SOURCES_CENSUS: CLEAN (contract v1 + H4 id-or-path)`), not the v1
  `sources-census.sh` named in the K2 row. Fleet census:
  `TZ=UTC bash …/fleet-census/scripts/sources-census.sh validate <worktree>`
  → `tameshi-shokunin ok`, exit 0. K2 admitted.
- Axis verdicts: calibration improved (0 → 6 pinned); all others
  unchanged. Trends: expansion improved; **quality unchanged** (not
  improved); discernment per the orchestrator's adjudication.

## Capabilities

| Capability | What it can now do | Evidence pointer | First-working round |
|---|---|---|---|
| sources-registry | curate where the lane learns: opened, tiered, rechecked source rows, mined into admitted entries, census-gated | `bash .ufo/evidence/kaika-round-1/sources-census-v2.sh` → exit 0, 44 rows, `SOURCES_CENSUS: CLEAN (contract v1 + H4 id-or-path)`; `corpus/SOURCES.md` | fleet round 1 (kaika) |
| mutation sweep runner | inject → run → restore single-edit mutants with a green-control gate, verdict lines and byte-identity proof | `bash tools/mutate-and-run.sh --selftest` → `MUTATE_SELFTEST: 80/80 pass`, exit 0 (`.ufo/evidence/kaika-round-1/capability-demo/h1a-selftest-host.stdout`) | historical round 3 (`SCORECARD.md:16`); re-demonstrated fleet round 1 |
| six-leg regression ledger | replay every recorded mutation case at its pinned blob; exact expectation | `bash tools/mutate-and-run.sh --regression` → `REGRESSION: PASS (cases=6 passed=6 …)`, exit 0 (`…/capability-demo/h1b-regression.stdout`) | historical round 7 (four legs) / round 10 (six); re-demonstrated fleet round 1 |
| repeated pristine-control gate | observe N≥3 exact exit/stdout/stderr tuples, distinguish mismatch from unavailable/uniform-nonzero baseline, validate digest-pinned observation snapshots | `python3 tools/repeat-control.py --selftest` → PASS (29 cases), exit 0; real bash controls match; red-before loop mutant fails the same mismatch oracle, restored loop passes; `.ufo/evidence/round-12/verification-final.json`, `oracle-repair.json`; measured `9df9212d33dc2dbda133e88f28ad47bb08839a5b` | round 12; lane demonstrated, outside admission pending |

Rows enter only through a round that demonstrates the capability running (`AXES.md` §Capabilities); none enter through this rollout.

## Saturation

The lane's saturation line + stagnation window N are to be declared by the lane on its next round per `AXES.md` §The stagnation nudge; not asserted by this conformance change.

Declared fleet round 1 (kaika): **saturation line 8/10** on each owned
axis — calibration's lane-attainable cap is 8, the last 2 need
independent review; depth is capped at 10 recorded cases. **Stagnation
window N = 2** completed rounds without a capability entering the
table. Policy choices, not observations; the nudge does not fire now
(depth 6 < 8; calibration pinned 0, candidate 8 pending).

## Planned

Populated by the lane at each round start per the `SCORECARD.md` contract (`AXES.md` §SCORECARD.md contract); no entries declared by this rollout.

Round 2 (declared fleet round 1, kaika):

1. **freshness** — re-sweep the two `stale` ledger legs (tsukuroi,
   mado) at live revisions and pin a freshness rubric. Before: pin
   read 4 current · 2 stale · 0 drift → after 6 · 0 · 0. Count:
   `grep -c 'stale' corpus/knowledge/fleet-kill-rate-ledger.md` plus the
   tool's pin read.
2. **capability (frontier F3)** — repeated-control determinism gate:
   one control per sweep (`…/capability-demo/README.md` H2) → N ≥ 3
   byte-identical controls or a named mismatch.
3. **depth** — witness-scoped split on a bash leg (surface-census)
   recorded as a ledger case. Before: command D 6 → after 7.

## Retired

- none retired; record with justification when an axis is retired.


## Round 12 — measured claims (steered round 12, 2026-10-20)

The old round-2 plan above supplied F3/F2 starting points, not permission
to add a seventh ledger leg. Freshness successor re-sweeps are not claimed.
The “6 → 7” prediction is rejected and superseded: reanalysis of the same
bash target is depth within a case, not a new independent case.

Counting command, run from this repo on both revisions:
`python3 .ufo/evidence/round-12/measure.py --rev REV`.
Before: `18ad5d050ef4bcd830fe513825baed878f025024`;
after/measured content: `9df9212d33dc2dbda133e88f28ad47bb08839a5b`.
Exact outputs: `.ufo/evidence/round-12/resumed-before.json` and
`after-committed.json`. This metadata commit records that already
measured content; it does not pretend to measure itself.

| Claim | Axis / type | Falsifiable before → after | Score delta | Verdict / evidence | Measured commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 repeated pristine controls | calibration; capability acquisition (F3) | repeat-control artifact 0 → 1, accompanied by executed 29-case CLI selftest, frozen match/mismatch, three actual matching bash controls and failing single-control mutant | calibration 6 → 6, delta 0; capability gained, no promotion points | improved, lane-measured; `verification-final.json`, `oracle-repair.json`, `SKILL.md` gate registry | `9df9212d33dc2dbda133e88f28ad47bb08839a5b` |
| C2 bash witness detail | depth; axis move on existing case (F2) | bash summary absent / classified defects 0 → 10, 8 witness hits / 0 accidental / 2 survived / 0 inconclusive; 14 exercised + 2 skipped case slots | depth 6 → 6, delta 0; six independent ledger cases remain six | improved, bounded case-label attribution; six specific hits, two generic-only, one extra B3 failure; `BashWitness/summary.json`, main `check`/`count` in final verification receipt | `9df9212d33dc2dbda133e88f28ad47bb08839a5b` |

Both owned axes tie at 6; C2 works the lowest depth axis. C1 may be
read as capability acquisition without forcing the historical
promotion-restraint score to count a tool. Their runtime commands are
independent; C2 does not import or invoke C1. Neither is a blind
prediction test or a proof of assertion-level causality.

Scalar commands D and C remain historical: D prints recorded_cases=6;
C prints asserted_mark_upper_bound=8, not the pinned score. The outside
round-1 adjudication excludes box 3; measure.py reports scored boxes
1/2/4 and calibration_restraint_score=6. Marks are not a fresh authority
or source-support check. The unique-gate count is a reported guardrail,
not automatic duplicate-proofing of command D.

| Axis | Round-12 lane verdict | Bound |
|---|---|---|
| depth | improved (detail), scalar unchanged 6 | C2; no new recorded case |
| calibration | improved (capability), scalar unchanged 6 | C1 and learned criterion13; no independent promotion credit |
| coverage | unchanged | new F3 knowledge indexed, no numerical coverage claim |
| operability | unchanged | runner unchanged; 80-case selftest and six-leg regression PASS |
| freshness | unchanged | no stale-successor re-pin claimed |
| adjacency | unchanged | sibling target/object store read-only; no province takeover |

Admission remains pending separate non-author closure and admit/reject
sampling. All four SHONEN marks stay `[~]`; box 3 stays scope-limited
and unscored. Saturation 8 and stagnation window 2 remain; no retirement.

Next intended claim: freshness — measure and disposition the existing
stale-successor ledger debt at actual pinned revisions. This is a plan,
not a round-13 execution or pre-claimed outcome.
